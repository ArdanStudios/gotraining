## Packaging Design

Packages contain the basic unit of compiled code. They define a scope for the identifiers that are declared within them. Learning how to package our code is vital because exported identifiers become part of the packages API. Stable and usable API's are incredibly important.

## An Interview with Brian Kernighan

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mihaib/kernighan-interview/index.html

_"Can you tell us about the worse features of C, from your point of view"?_

_"I think that the real problem with C is that it doesn't give you enough mechanisms for structuring really big programs, for creating ``firewalls'' within programs so you can keep the various pieces apart. It's not that you can't do all of these things, that you can't simulate object-oriented programming or other methodology you want in C. You can simulate it, but the compiler, the language itself isn't giving you any help."_ - July 2000

## Quotes

_"Object orientation is very useful in some settings... As languages evolve, there will surely be other mechanisms for packaging up computational units and organizing a program." - Brain Kernighan (2009)_
