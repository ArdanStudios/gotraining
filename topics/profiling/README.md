## Profiling Code

We can use the go tooling to inspect and profile our programs. Profiling is more of a journey and detective work. It requires some understanding about the application and expectations. The profiling data in and of itself is just raw numbers. We have to give it meaning and understanding.

## Installing Tools

**Graph Visualization Tools**    
Download the package for your target OS/Arch:
[http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php](http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php)

**Ghostscript**    
Download and uncompress the source code:
[http://ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html](http://ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html)

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

**boom**  
boom is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating the load you need to run tests. It's built using the Go language and leverages goroutines for behind the scenes async IO and concurrency.

	go get -u github.com/rakyll/boom

## Building and Running the Project

We have a website that we will use to learn and explore more about profiling. This project is a search engine for RSS feeds. Run the website and validate it is working.

	go build
	./project

	http://localhost:5000/search

## Adding Load

To add load to the service while running profiling we can run these command.

	// Send 100k request using 8 connections.
	boom -m POST -c 8 -n 100000 "http://localhost:5000/search?term=house&cnn=on&bbc=on&nyt=on"

## GODEBUG

GODEBUG is an environment variable that allows us to get information from the runtime about the scheduler and the garabage collector.

### The Basics

Learn the basics of using GODEBUG for tracing.  
[Memory Tracing](godebug/gctrace) | [Scheduler Tracing](godebug/schedtrace)

### Memory Trace for Project

Run the website redirecting the stdout (logs) to the null device. This will allow us to just see the trace information from the runtime.
	
	GODEBUG=gctrace=1 ./project > /dev/null

Put some load of the web application.

	boom -m POST -c 8 -n 10000 "http://localhost:5000/search?term=house&cnn=on&bbc=on&nyt=on"

### Scheduler Trace for Project

Run the website redirecting the stdout (logs) to the null device. This will allow us to just see the trace information from the runtime.
	
	GODEBUG=schedtrace=1000 GOMAXPROCS=2 ./project > /dev/null

Put some load of the web application.

	boom -m POST -c 8 -n 10000 "http://localhost:5000/search?term=house&cnn=on&bbc=on&nyt=on"

## PPROF

Go provides built in support for retrieving profiling data from your running Go applications.

### Raw http/pprof

We already added the following import so we can include the profiling route to our web service.

	import _ "net/http/pprof"

Look at the basic profiling stats from the new endpoint.

	http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof

Run a single search from the Browser and then refresh the profile information.

	http://localhost:5000/search?term=house&cnn=on

Put some load of the web application. Review the raw profiling information once again.

	boom -m POST -c 8 -n 10000 "http://localhost:5000/search?term=house&cnn=on&bbc=on&nyt=on"

### Interactive Profiling

Using the Go pprof tool we can interact with the profiling data.

Put some load of the web application using a single connection.

 	boom -m POST -c 1 -n 100000 "http://localhost:5000/search?term=house&cnn=on&bbc=on&nyt=on"

Run the Go pprof tool in another window or tab to review heap information.

	go tool pprof ./project http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/heap

Run the Go pprof tool in another window or tab to review cpu information.

	go tool pprof ./project http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/profile

Explore using the **top**, **list** and **web list** commands.

### Generate PDF Call Graph

Generate call graphs for both the cpu and memory profiles.

	// Create output files.
	curl -s http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.out
	go tool pprof ./project cpu.out
	(pprof) web

	curl -s http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/heap > mem.out
	go tool pprof ./project mem.out
	(pprof) web

	// Call into the endpoints directly and generate graphs.
	go tool pprof -web ./project http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/heap
	go tool pprof -web ./project http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/profile

## Go Torch

Tool for stochastically profiling Go programs. Collects stack traces and synthesizes them into a flame graph.

	https://github.com/uber/go-torch

Put some load of the web application.

	boom -m POST -c 8 -n 100000 "http://localhost:5000/search?term=house&cnn=on&bbc=on&nyt=on"

Run the torch tool and visualize the profile.

	go-torch -u http://localhost:5000/

## Comparing Profiles

Take a snapshot of the current heap profile. Then do the same for the cpu profile.

    curl -s http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/heap > base.heap

After some time, take another snapshot:

    curl -s http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/heap > current.heap

Now compare both snapshots against the binary and get into the pprof tool:

    go tool pprof -alloc_space -base base.heap memory_trace current.heap

    -inuse_space  : Display in-use memory size
    -inuse_objects: Display in-use object counts
    -alloc_space  : Display allocated memory size
    -alloc_objects: Display allocated object counts

## Profiling With Benchmarks

Most of the time these large profiles are not going to help refine potential problems. There is too much noise in the data. This is when isolating a profile with a banchmark becomes important.

Run the test and produce a cpu and memory profile.

	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/topics/profiling/project/search
	
	go test -run none -bench . -benchtime 3s -cpuprofile cpu.out
	go tool pprof ./search.test cpu.out
	(pprof) web list rssSearch

	go test -run none -bench . -benchtime 3s -memprofile mem.out
	go tool pprof -alloc_space ./search.test mem.out
	(pprof) web list rssSearch

## Tracing

Tracing provides the ability to get to even more information. This includes blocking and latency information.

### The Basics

Learn the basics of using the tracing tool.  
[Tracing Examples](trace)

### Tracing Web Application

Put some load of the web application.

	boom -m POST -c 8 -n 100000 "http://localhost:5000/search?term=house&cnn=on&bbc=on&nyt=on"

Capture a trace file for a brief duration.

	curl -s http://localhost:5000/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=2 > trace.out

Run the Go trace tool.

	go tool trace trace.out

Use the RSS Search test instead.

	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/topics/profiling/project/search
	go test -run none -bench . -benchtime 3s -trace trace.out
	go tool trace trace.out

Explore the trace.
