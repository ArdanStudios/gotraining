## Ultimate Web - APIs
By this point we should be able to build fully featured HTML applications in Go, but the fun doesn’t stop there. Let’s turn an eye to building APIs for other applications to consume. We’ll look at two different ways of building APIs (RESTful & HyperMedia), we’ll also look at different ways to handle that age old question of versioning and API.

### Versioning

[Inline Versioning](../../../topics/web/apis/example1/main.go)

[Header Versioning](../../../topics/web/apis/example2/main.go)

### RESTful

[Pat Implementation](../../../topics/web/apis/example3/main.go)

[HttpRouter Implementation](../../../topics/web/apis/example4/main.go)

[Echo Implementation](../../../topics/web/apis/example5/main.go)
