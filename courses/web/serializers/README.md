## Ultimate Web - Data Serialization
An API is nothing if we don’t have a way of serializing the data we want to send. We’ll look at 2 common data formats, as well as ways to customize those formats to match the needs of your API.

### JSON

[Standard](../../../topics/web/serializers/example1/main.go)

[Custom Marshaling](../../../topics/web/serializers/example2/main.go)

### XML

[Standard](../../../topics/web/serializers/example3/main.go)

[Custom Marshaling](../../../topics/web/serializers/example4/main.go)
